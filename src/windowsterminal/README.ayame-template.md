# Windows Terminal

Ayame is available for [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

To install a theme, select it from [the list](#themes) and add it to `schemes` in `settings.json`. The settings JSON can be opened by `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`,`. Alternatively, it can be opened by opening settings (default: `Ctrl`+`,`), then clicking on "Open JSON file" in the bottom-left corner of the window.
